## Getting started

This is a web application with only one HTML file and one JavaScript file.

### What's included

```
Kogan-Challenge-DiliWu/
├──challenge.html
└──averageCubicWeight.js
```

### How to run (locally)

Assume you have got one of the popular browsers as your default choice.

Currently, the .html file and the .js file are located in the same folder. So the only thing that you need to do is just double click the .html file, and wait for the web browser to pop-up the page.

Just one more step, click that button. Then, boom!



If you tackle with any problem, please don't hesitate let me know!

Have a good day!

Enjoy!
